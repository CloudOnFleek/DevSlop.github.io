## OWASP DevSlop Modules

DevSlop has different modules that make up the project.  You can use one, some, or all of them.  They are all maintained to function independantly of each other.

### Pixi-CRS

This module is lead by [Franziska BÃ¼hler](team.md).

DevSlop's Pixi, the first application for this OWASP project, is currently publicly available for your hacking and learning pleasure. Pixi is available in several docker containers and consists of a vulnerable web app and API service.  The intent is to teach users how to test modern web applications and API's for security issues and how to write more secure API's in the future. 

Code to be found [here](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi).


### Patty (no more maintained)

This module was lead by [Tanya Janca](team.md).

The old DevSlop website was the Patty Module proof of concept built with an Azure + ASP.Net Core DevSecOps pipeline. It released the website/web app through the pipeline to demonstrate implemented security automation.
