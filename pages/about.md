## OWASP DevSlop Tool Project

Learning by teaching and doing.
    
The DevSlop Project (Sloppy DevOps) is a project created by 4 friends who wanted to learn how to weave security through DevOps. 

* How can we add automated security testing to a pipeline? 
* How does one do security testing on DevOps systems? 
* How do we secure the cloud?  How can we hack APIs?  

All of these questions and more are what we attempt to answer via

<a href="https://devslop.co/Home/Schedule">public talks and workshops</a>,
<a href="https://aka.ms/DevSlopShow">our videos</a>, as well as our <a href="https://devslop.co/Home/Schedule">
        pipelines and apps</a>.
