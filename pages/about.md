## OWASP DevSlop Project

Learning by teaching and doing.
    
The DevSlop Project (Sloppy DevOps) is a project created by 4 friends who wanted to learn how to weave security through DevOps. 

* How can we add automated security testing to a pipeline? 
* How does one do security testing on DevOps systems? 
* How do we secure the cloud?  How can we hack APIs?  

All of these questions and more are what we attempt to answer via

* [Public Talks and Workshops](pages/schedule.md)
* [YouTube DevSlop Shows](https://aka.ms/DevSlopShow)
* [Pipelines and Apps](https://github.com/devslop)
