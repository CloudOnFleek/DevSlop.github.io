## Patty The Pipeline 

The old website was the Patty Module proof of concept! Built with an Azure + ASP.Net Core DevSecOps pipeline, it released the old website/web app through the pipeline to demonstrate implemented security automation. Most of the learning of this module was done on the [YouTube Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyxbNw11fMUgoR3XpVYVPIQ), where [Tanya](https://aka.ms/SheHacksPurpleBlog), Nancy and friends explore various technical solutions in attempts to automate AppSec as much as possible.

This module was lead by [Tanya Janca](https://aka.ms/SheHacksPurpleBlog).

We stream our tech work live on [Mixer](https://aka.ms/DevSlop-Mixer) and [Twitch](https://aka.ms/DevSlopTwitch) and you can find out when by [joining our meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-DevSlop-Project/).  

Code for the old website, Devslop.co, is [here](https://github.com/DevSlop/DevSlop.co).
Code for 'Patty the pipeline' was only available as a JSON export, and is not fantastic for importing, so we're not sharing it.
